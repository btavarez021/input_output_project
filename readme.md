This application will keep track of menu items for any small/large business. It is meant to add categories of food i.e. Burgers, Tacos, Pizza, etc.

How it works:
    You have four menu options:
    1. Add Menu Items
       - You are allowed to add the food category, the name of the item, and the price.
         - i.e. Burger, Baconator, 12.99
       2. View Menu Entries
          - You are allowed to view the entire menu that you entered in step 1.
       3. Delete one menu item
          - If you made a mistake or do not want the item any longer, this will let you delete that specific item.
          - You will need to enter the food category and then the name of the item that you want deleted.
       4. Delete all menu items
           - You can delete entire menu and restart again.

Testing:

1. You can test that the menu is empty
2. You can test that the "add" entry feature works.
3. You can test that the delete all items works.
